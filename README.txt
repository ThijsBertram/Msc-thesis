This README contains instructions on how to replicate the experiments conducted in 'Deep convolutional neural network ensembles for art classification"

1. Download and extract Rijksmuseum.zip
2. Run 'create partition & labes.py'
3. Train and save models (and model predictions) running 'train.ipynb' on the Google Colab platform. Note: upload 'data.zip', 'partition' and 'labels' to Google Colaboratory
4. Get results by running 'results.py'

Note: there could still be some bugs wrt directories. Contact me if any issues remain unsolvable
